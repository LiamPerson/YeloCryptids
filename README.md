# YeloCryptids
 An old game I made when I was 13 (2012). First ever code project.


Back before I knew about ascii and coding conventions.
Kind of what a project looks like when you have zero coding experience and knowledge, no help tutorials, and are just trying stuff until something works.

Game is the Batch File for use in Windows Command Prompt
Keycode is for unlocking the premium package ingame.

Used to charge 10c a copy (of the exe file) but now I bring it to the public.
